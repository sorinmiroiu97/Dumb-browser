# Dumb-browser
This is just a dumb browser used by noone

Small project that needs further work. Maybe I'll improve it someday. It works just fine for browsing the internet, but it doesn't support any fancy animation because, as I said, it's a "dumb browser".
P.S: It also has a home button in the top left corner which redirects you to the home page (google).
